                  <h2>I Love Computers</h2>
                  <p>Computers were introduced to me as an accessibility device for my mother, and as a result they've always been a tool that allows us to do things that we can't - things that are otherwise beyond our capabilities. That allow us to stretch beyond our limitations. I can still see that in them and their seemingly limitless potential. How they can help each of us and individuals, me, personally, and all of humanity do and create amazing things. How could I not fall endlessly in love with them? Forever?</p>

            <h2>I Love the Internet</h2>
            <p>I’ve always been fascinated by the internet's vast capabilities, finding myself exploring every corner and discovering its various tools and platforms. As a result, I've collected an eclectic set of skills. but through it all, I've never lost my early passion for websites. In the vast landscape of the internet, if anything could be considered our home, it's our website.</p>

            <h2>Websites and Applications are Communication</h2>
            <p>In this way, websites - and web applications (just a website in fancy clothes) - are the ultimate form of communication between their creator and the user. Crafting this interaction — through deliberate choices in colors, layout, and branding — fascinates me. It's about setting the tone, inspiring interaction, and guiding the user experience with as much care and intention as an author choosing their words or a director staging a scene. You create atmostphere, beckon users down a pathway, invoke feelings and emotions, and construct a narrative.</p>
            
            <h2>I Love Building Things</h2>
            <p>At my center, like most of us, I'm an artist, so I like to build things. But building things, like art, is all about experiences. And my early immersion in programming and website development means I am also familiar with SEO, Digital Marketing, and graphic design — back when they were indistinguishable from website development — which gave me a holistic perspective that I consider a privilege. Understanding how the technical mechanics of a website mesh with user experience, SEO, and social media is crucial. Designing for both humans and search engines alike is not just a skill but a necessity in today’s digital landscape. Recognizing that while everyone is trying to cater to Google, Google is trying to force them to cater to humans, and ultimately humans are the ones who will or won't use your product or service is an essential understanding. Websites (and applications!) need to be buld for people.</p>
