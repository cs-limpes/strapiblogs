                  <h2>My Background in Technology</h2>
                  <h3>...and How I Got Here</h3>
                  <p class="aboutp">My journey into the world of technology began in 1994, sparked by a horrifying life-altering event. After my mother became a quadrilateral amputee and spent several months in rehabilitation, the state of California provided us with an IBM 386 running Windows 3.1 on DOS 6.0. This machine wasn't just a piece of technology - it became a gateway to a new world for us. Even though my mother faced the challenges of using a computer, and the entirety of life forever, without limbs, it opened up possibilities that were previously unimaginable for my entire family - but especially for me. Without any reservation whatsoever, I can say that this completely changed my life - I would lose my mother a few years later, but the technology that was gifted to our family would change the path of life entirely.</p>

                  <p class="aboutp">This computer, prone to frequent breakdowns, introduced me to the realm of tech support, IT troubleshooting, and computer programming. A kind tech support specialist took me under her wing, and before I knew it, I was in love with the field. I built my own 8088 from spare parts and took my first steps into becoming the software engineer, architect, and consultant I am today.</p>

                  <h3>Formal Classes and Self Teaching</h3>

                  <p class="aboutp">My high school had just introduced new computer programming curricula where I learned Basic, Pascal, and C++, and Microsoft Office. After high school, HTML and CSS became my tools of choice, thanks to GeoCities, and I ventured into JavaScript and PHP, crafting websites for anyone who needed them.</p>

                  <p class="aboutp">My college didn't offer a computer science program and I pursued dual majors in Psychology/Philosophy, a decision that didn't deter my tech journey. My fascination with digital landscapes only grew, leading me to freelance website development, SEO, and digital marketing, marking my pivot from a corporate healthcare accreditation career to embracing my true calling.</p>
                  
                  <h3>A Holistic Approach</h3>
                  
                  <p>Website development used to encompass SEO, Digital Marketing, and graphic design and since I started creating websites when websites were first being developed, I learned these skills as well. Understanding the relationship between technical mechanics, user experience, SEO, and content marketing has been central to my strategy, ensuring success for the clients I work with.</p>

                  <h2>Professional  Highlights</h2>

                  <h3>2023: Software Engineer at DO&Be Marketing Agency</h3>
                  <p class="aboutp">Joining DO&Be Marketing Agency as a Software Engineer, I've spearheaded digital marketing initiatives, led strategic software redevelopment, and enhanced operational efficiency through team restructuring and innovative application development. My role as a technical liaison and project leader has underscored my commitment to bridging business needs with technological solutions.</p>

                  <h3>2022: Group Two and Dell Technologies</h3>
                  <p class="aboutp">Returning to corporate work, I contributed to Dell Technologies and Group Two Advertising, focusing on WCAG 2.1 compliance audits, accessibility testing, and cybersecurity. My work led to significant reductions in website development timelines and fortified digital assets against cyber threats.</p>

                  <h3>2008 - 2022: Consultancy and Freelance</h3>
                  <p class="aboutp">Spanning over a decade, my consultancy work specialized in custom website development and marketing solutions, emphasizing CMS solutions, brand visibility, and client empowerment.</p>

                  <h3>Early Years in Healthcare</h3>
                  <p class="aboutp">My career began at CARF, where I was the primary contact for a custom CRM and played a crucial role in data analysis, creating regulations, working with a variety of government agencies at the state and federal level, creating and streamling company processes, and creating and reorganizing company departments.</p>

                  <h2>At the Heart of Technology</h2>
                  <p class="aboutp">Technology, to me, is an accessibility device first and foremost. It's a tool that amplifies our capabilities, connecting us to knowledge, experiences, and communities we might never have accessed otherwise. My journey, marked by personal challenges and professional milestones, reflects a deep personal belief in the ability of technology to transform lives. As I continue to contribute to this ever-evolving field through innovation, mentorship, and leadership, I'm reminded of the incredible journey that technology has taken me on â€” a journey that's only just beginning.</p>
