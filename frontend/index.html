                  <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
                  <p>I have two decades of experience in software engineering, architecture, and application development</p>

                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <p>I began my journey building computers, setting up networks, and writing desktop applications.</p>
                  <p >Then I fell in love with the internet, teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                  <p>Since then, I've had a beautiful software development career, focused on building websites and applications for small businesses, independent artists, and non-profit organizations and began work as a consultant, advising on architecture, building engineering teams, and product development.</p>
                  <p>I truly believe that technology is a tool that can make lives better, easier, and more productive - taking humanity to places we only ever dreamed of and I'm extremely excited about and proud of my contributions to that development. </p>

            <h2>Three things I stand behind:</h2>
            <div class="threethings">
                  <p class="thing">I'm passionate about user experience and believe strongly in listening to the people using your product - external and internal. They know best how a product is being used rather than how it was intended to be used and it's essential to listen to their feedback and requests.</p>
                  <p class="thing">A truly intuitive user interface has yet to be developed - we have all been taught to use websites and applications and because they all use similar interfaces, they "feel" intuitive - but they aren't.</p>
                  <p class="thing">Accessibility is essential and the curb cut effect is real. If you ignore disabled and otherwise impaired users, your product will suffer and you will be left behind - this user group needs to be top of your list instead of an after thought.</p>
